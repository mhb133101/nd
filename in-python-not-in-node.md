Python and Node.js both have extensive libraries and frameworks for various tasks, but there are certain areas where Python offers libraries or categories that either don't have a direct equivalent in Node.js or have fewer options. Here are some notable categories:

### 1. **Data Science and Scientific Computing**
   - **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations that provides support for arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.
   - **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures for efficiently storing large datasets.
   - **SciPy**: Builds on NumPy to provide additional functionality for scientific and technical computing, including modules for optimization, integration, and statistics.
   - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization that allow users to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

### 2. **Machine Learning and AI**
   - **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: While there are machine learning libraries available in Node.js, such as TensorFlow.js, they are not as comprehensive or widely used as their Python counterparts.
   - **Scikit-learn**: A simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis that integrates well with NumPy and Pandas.

### 3. **Web Scraping**
   - **Beautiful Soup**: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents, primarily used for web scraping.
   - **Scrapy**: A powerful framework for web scraping that can handle requests, data extraction, and storage.

### 4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A comprehensive library for working with human language data (text) that includes tools for text processing, classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.
   - **spaCy**: An industrial-strength NLP library that is designed specifically for production use.

### 5. **Bioinformatics**
   - **Biopython**: A set of freely available tools for biological computation that enables users to work with biological data in Python.
   - **BioPandas**: Extends the Pandas library to facilitate the analysis of molecular structures.

### 6. **Mathematical Libraries**
   - **SymPy**: A Python library for symbolic mathematics that provides capabilities for algebra, calculus, and other mathematical computations.

### 7. **Web Frameworks with Unique Features**
   - **Django**: A high-level web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. While Node.js has frameworks like Express, Django offers built-in features such as an ORM, authentication, and admin panel that are more comprehensive.

### 8. **Statistical Analysis**
   - **Statsmodels**: A library for estimating and interpreting statistical models, focusing on statistics rather than machine learning.

### 9. **Game Development**
   - **Pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, which has more educational resources and a strong community for beginners.

### Conclusion
While many tasks can be accomplished in both Python and Node.js, Python's ecosystem offers a wealth of libraries specifically tailored for data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and more that either lack direct equivalents in Node.js or are less mature. If you are working in these fields, Python might be a better choice due to its robust library support.
